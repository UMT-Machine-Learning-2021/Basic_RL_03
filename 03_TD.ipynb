    "Now that we have learned a little about Monte Carlo Methods, let's move on to Temporal Difference(TD) Learning.\n",
    "The plan for the week is to do a small lecture Tuesday to review the TD material then jump into an exercise.\n",
    "If we complete that exercise, we will do a really fun exercise using the same TD methods Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please watch the videos bellow.\n",
    "There is not a lot of material here, but it is dense.\n",
    "I recommend taking notes and reviewing the videos a few times until you have a solid understanding of the material.\n",
    "Lastly, don't be afraid to review the MC control material; it is very helpful in understanding the motivation for TD learning.\n",
